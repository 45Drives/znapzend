receive todo it's work. It has the built-in ability to to manage both local
snapshots as well as remote copies by thining them out as time progresses.

itself.

 # wget https://github.com/oetiker/znapzend/releases/download/v0.3.0/znapzend-0.3.0.tar.gz
 # tar zxvf znapzend-0.3.0.tar.gz
 # cd znapzend-0.3.0
 # ./configure --prefix=/opt/znapzend-0.3.0

 # ./setup/build-thirdparty.sh /opt/znapzend-0.3.0/thirdparty

now you can run configure again and then
