=head1 DESCRIPTION

Znapzend is a snapshot based zfs backup daemon creating snapshots on a
scheduled basis on the source filesystem and on a destination filesystem

=head2 Create Command

The heart of the znapzend backup is the plan. The plan specifies how often
to backup and for how long to keep the backups.  A plan is required both for
the source and the destination datasets.

The plan consists of a series on retension periodes to interval
associations:

  retA=>intA,retB=>intB,...

Both intervals and retension periods are expressed in standard units of time
or multiples of them. You can use both the full name or a shortcut according
to the following table:

 sec|s
 minute|min|M
 hour|h
 day|d
 week|w
 mon|month|m
 year|y

To keep one copy every 30 minutes for one week, specify:
 
 1week=>30min

To keep one copy every two days for 10 years:

 2day=>10year
