# Windows script files should be CR+LF always:
*.bat text eol=crlf

# Unix/Linux script files should be LF always:
*.sh text eol=lf
*.m4 text eol=lf
*.ac text eol=lf
*.am text eol=lf
/conftools/* text eol=lf

# Buildable sources (mostly for docker on windows builds to pass):
*.in text eol=lf
*.pm text eol=lf
/bin/* text eol=lf

# Some files are binary always:
*.png bin
*.ico bin

# The rest are assumed text sources with platform-dependent EOL being okay,
# or we let Git guess otherwise:
#* text=auto
* text=auto eol=lf
